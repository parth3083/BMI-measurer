# BMI-measurer
<br>
The Body Mass Index (BMI) of an individual is determined by this Java programme using the individual's height and weight. BMI is an easy-to-use, but straightforward measure of a person's total body fat that may be used to determine if they are underweight, normal weight, overweight, or obese. The application will calculate the user's BMI once they enter their weight in kilogrammes and height in metres. Additionally, it offers an interpretation of the BMI result, stating whether the user is overweight, obese, underweight, or fits into one of the other BMI categories. With the help of this programme, people may quickly and simply evaluate their health and decide what level of fitness and well-being is right for them."
